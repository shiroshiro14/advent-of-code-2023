<h1>My participation in Advent of Code 2023</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
<h3>Part 1:</h3>
<p>Iterate through the string twice:</p> 
<p>First iteration: forward until found first digit</p>
<p>Second iteration: backward until found first digit (which is the last digit of said line)</p>

<h3>Part 2:</h3>
<p>Iterate through the entire string once, and search for digit (1-9) or numbering (one to nine) using regular expression</p>

<h2>Day 2:<h2>
<h3>Part 1:</h3>
<p>Split each line down to "[number] [red|blue|green]", then count each type of ball</p>
<h3>Part 2:</h3>
<p>Not much different from part 1, just different comparison needed.</p>
